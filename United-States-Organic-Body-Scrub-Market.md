Online platforms, such as e-retailers and brand-specific websites, offer a vast selection of organic body scrubs with detailed product information, reviews, and convenient delivery options. The rise of social media influencers and online communities promoting organic beauty products has played a significant role in shaping consumer preferences. Online shopping allows consumers to explore different brands and formulations, read customer feedback, and make informed purchasing decisions.
